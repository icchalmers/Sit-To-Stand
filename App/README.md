# Sit-To-Stand Android App

The Android app was developed in Android Studio 1.5.1.

It is VERY much a "work in progress". There is very little error checking, program flow and control is disjointed and I have very little Android development experience...
It does, however, work (mainly...).

Most of the testing was done on a OnePlus One running Cyanogen 12.1.1 (Android 5.1.1). Testing was also done on a Moto G (1st gen) running Android 5.1.

Note that the app is written assuming the phone is strapped to the users chest in the portrait position. 

An unsigned APK is supplied to get going if you don't want to setup Android Studio.
