# BLEVibrator Hardware

The hardware for the Sit-To-Stand project can be split into three parts:

* The PCB and electronics (in the "PCB" folder)
* The 3D printed case (in the "Case" folder)
* The adjustable strap to attach the vibrator units/phone to the user (The strap was designed by a collegue of mine - I'll add design files when I get them)

# Cost

The most expensive components are the RFDuino module, the LiPo batter and the vibration motor. At a rough guess, I would say a full vibration unit can be made in single quantity for < Â£30. Obviously making them in quantity would bring this down significantly.
