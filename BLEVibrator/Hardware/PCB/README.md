# BLE Vibrator: PCB

The PCB was designed in KiCAD. It is a singled sided board. I cut mine on a Denford PCB Engraver (the files for that specific machine are in the "DenfordPCBEngraver" folder). 
Gerbers are also included for edge cuts and front copper. Those were the only layers I needed. If you need something else (e.g. solder mask) then you'll need to generate the gerbers yourself.

Note that the PCB design has only been manufactered on the Denford. The footprints might be totally unnacceptable for a proper fab house!
